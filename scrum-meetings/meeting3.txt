Minutes from Previous Meeting:
During the previous meeting, the team established the foundation for the Sharetea customer kiosk project. The group discussed the overall project goals, including creating an interactive ordering system to improve customer experience and streamline store operations. The team collaborated to create the initial product backlog, identifying core features such as the menu interface, order customization, payment integration, and database connectivity. After reviewing each item, the group assigned story points to prioritize key tasks for the first development sprint. Roles and early technical research areas were also outlined to prepare for implementation.
