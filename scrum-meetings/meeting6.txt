Minutes from Previous Meeting:  
During the previous meeting, the team reviewed previous sprint deliverables and prepared for Sprint 3. Google OAuth was confirmed fully functional, accessibility features (Screen Magnifier and High Contrast) for the "Vishnu" persona were implemented, and the Weather API was integrated successfully. Backend API calls for the Employee Panel were completed, and the Cart interface was built. The team assigned tasks for the next sprint, including fully implementing Employee Panel functionality, developing inventory management logic, beginning payment gateway integration, and preparing UX testing. The Employee Panel API calls were operational but still required full frontend integration.
