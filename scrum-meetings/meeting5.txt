Minutes from Previous Meeting:
During the 11/21 meeting, the team reviewed successful completion of the research phase. Prisha confirmed the Google Cloud project configuration, Athul demonstrated the Weather API JSON response, and Mason and Zaheer created the API calls for the Employee and Manager pages. The team then assigned implementation tasks, focusing on Accessibility features for the Vishnu persona and ensuring Cart logic was completed before the end of the sprint. The Employee Panel API calls are working but still require full frontend integration.
